## Final Project

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The Gaming Room, a client, had a game called Draw It or Lose It for Android that they wanted to improve and expand to other platforms. 
As a developer, I created a clear and concise document outlining their software requirements. In the design process, I found working through the document helpful in keeping my focus on important tasks. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When interpreting the user's needs for The Gaming Room's Draw It or Lose It game, I focused on understanding the game's current functionality and how it could be improved to expand to other operating platforms. By breaking down the game's functionality, I was able to identify ways to improve the software's usability and maintainability while keeping the game consistent across platforms.

Considering the user's needs is essential in software design because the user is ultimately the one who will be using the product. Understanding the user's needs and preferences helps to ensure that the software is tailored to meet their requirements and is user-friendly. If the software does not meet the user's needs, they are unlikely to use it or may switch to a competitor's product, leading to a loss of revenue and potential negative reviews. Therefore, designing software with the user in mind is crucial for the success of the product.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one aspect of my work, I would improve the clarity of my recommendations. Understanding the intricacies of operating platforms and the differences between various operating systems can be challenging, and deciding on which one to select can be even more difficult. However, I am confident that with time and experience, I will be able to make more informed decisions regarding which operating system is best suited for a particular application.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In the future, when developing a similar application, I plan to apply the technique of isolating components to promote reusability. A good example is how I divided The Gaming Room into different classes that worked together to create a complete product. This technique is essential since in a previous project, I encountered difficulties because I could not isolate the components. Therefore, isolating components is a strategy that I found to be helpful and will use in similar projects.
