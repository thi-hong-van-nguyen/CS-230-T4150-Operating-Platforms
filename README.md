## Final Project

- The Gaming Room, a client, had a game called Draw It or Lose It for Android that they wanted to improve and expand to other platforms. 
- As a developer, I created a clear and concise document outlining their software requirements. In the design process, I found working through the document helpful in keeping my focus on important tasks. 
- If I could revise one part of my work, it would be to improve the clarity of recommendations. To interpret the user's needs, I focused on splitting up game functionality to expand to other platforms while keeping the game the same. Considering the user's needs is crucial in designing a successful product. For software design, my approach was to focus on clear documentation and separating game functionality for easier updates and maintenance.
- In the future, when developing a similar application, I plan to apply the technique of isolating components to promote reusability. A good example is how I divided The Gaming Room into different classes that worked together to create a complete product. This technique is essential since in a previous project, I encountered difficulties because I could not isolate the components. Therefore, isolating components is a strategy that I found to be helpful and will use in similar projects.
